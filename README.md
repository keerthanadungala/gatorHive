Project name - GatorHive

Problem Statement -
Students often face challenges in efficiently managing and organizing campus events. With a diverse range of academic, social, and extracurricular activities, there is a lack of a centralized platform tailored specifically to UF students to discover, promote, and coordinate events. Current solutions are fragmented, leading to communication gaps, low event visibility, and missed opportunities for collaboration.

This project aims to create a streamlined, user-friendly platform, GatorHive, to simplify event management. It will enable students to browse upcoming events, RSVP, create and promote their own events, and foster community engagement, all while reflecting the unique needs and culture of the University of Florida.
