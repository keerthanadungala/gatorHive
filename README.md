# **GatorHive**

## **Problem Statement**  
Students often face challenges in **efficiently managing and organizing campus events**. With a diverse range of **academic, social, and extracurricular activities**, there is a lack of a **centralized platform tailored specifically to UF students** to discover, promote, and coordinate events.  
Current solutions are **fragmented**, leading to:  
- **Communication gaps**  
- **Low event visibility**  
- **Missed opportunities for collaboration**  

This project aims to create a **streamlined, user-friendly GatorHive platform** to simplify event management. It will enable students to:  
- **Browse upcoming events**  
- **RSVP**  
- **Develop and promote their events**  
- **Foster community engagement**  

All while reflecting the **unique needs and culture of the University of Florida**.
