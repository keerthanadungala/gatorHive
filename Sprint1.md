# **Sprint 1 Report**

## **User Stories**

1. **As a user, I want to create an event** so that I can organize and share details with others.
2. **As a user, I want to view a list of upcoming events** so that I can decide which ones to attend.
3. **As a user, I want an intuitive navigation system** so that I can easily move between pages.
4. **As a user, I want a confirmation message after creating an event** so that I know my submission was successful.
5. **As a user, I want a visually appealing homepage** so that I feel engaged when visiting the site.

## **Planned Issues for Sprint 1**

1. Frontend environment setup.
2. Environment and code setup for backend.
3. Implement the event creation form.
4. Implement the event list display.
5. Set up navigation between pages using React Router.
6. Display a confirmation message upon event creation.
7. Add a background image to the home page for better UI appeal.
8. Implement Create Event API.
9. Implement List All Events API.

## **Successfully Completed Issues**
- Environment and code setup for backend and frontend.
- Implemented the event creation form.
- Implemented the event list display.
- Set up navigation using React Router.
- Displayed a confirmation message upon successful event creation.
- Added a background image to the homepage.
- Implemented Create Event API.
- Implemented List All Events API.

## **Issues Not Completed and Reasons**

- Persisting events after a page refresh – Currently, events are stored in React state but are lost on refresh. We planned to use localStorage, but this was deprioritized in favor of completing UI enhancements first.
  
- Event deletion feature – Not implemented due to time constraints, but will be included in the next sprint.

**Upcoming Sprints:** We will focus on event persistence using a database and adding a delete event feature. Additionally, we will work on **integrating the frontend with the backend** to enable full functionality and data persistence. We will also continue to add more features to improve user experience and expand the application's capabilities.
