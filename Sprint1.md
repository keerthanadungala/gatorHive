**# Sprint 1 Report**

## **User Stories**

1. **As a user, I want to create an event** so that I can organize and share details with others.
2. **As a user, I want to view a list of upcoming events** so that I can decide which ones to attend.
3. **As a user, I want an intuitive navigation system** so that I can easily move between pages.
4. **As a user, I want a confirmation message after creating an event** so that I know my submission was successful.
5. **As a user, I want a visually appealing homepage** so that I feel engaged when visiting the site.

## **Planned Issues for Sprint 1**

1. Implement the event creation form.
2. Implement the event list display.
3. Set up navigation between pages using React Router.
4. Display a confirmation message upon event creation.
5. Add a background image to the home page for better UI appeal.

## **Successfully Completed Issues**

- Implemented the event creation form.
- Implemented the event list display.
- Set up navigation using React Router.
- Displayed a confirmation message upon successful event creation.
- Added a background image to the homepage.

## **Issues Not Completed and Reasons**

- Persisting events after a page refresh – Currently, events are stored in React state but are lost on refresh. We planned to use localStorage, but this was deprioritized in favor of completing UI enhancements first.
- Event deletion feature – Not implemented due to time constraints, but will be included in the next sprint.

**Upcoming Sprints:** We will focus on event persistence using a database and adding a delete event feature. Additionally, we will work on **integrating the frontend with the backend** to enable full functionality and data persistence. We will also continue to add more features to improve user experience and expand the application's capabilities.
